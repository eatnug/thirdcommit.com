# Getting Started with Static Blogging

Static site generators are revolutionizing how we build and deploy blogs. Unlike traditional CMSs, they offer:

## Benefits

1. **Speed**: Pre-rendered HTML loads instantly
2. **Security**: No database means no SQL injection risks
3. **Cost**: Deploy for free on GitHub Pages
4. **Simplicity**: Write in Markdown, push to Git

## Writing Your First Post

Create a new `.md` file in the `content/posts/` directory:

```bash
touch content/posts/my-first-post.md
```

Add frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: My Amazing Post
date: 2025-01-22
tags: [personal, thoughts]
description: A brief description
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown below the frontmatter. It's that simple!

## Deployment

Once you're ready, just push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new post"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.
